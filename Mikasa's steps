Hoi Bois 
feels so long since i last uploaded any TUT 

so today most demanded youtube Tut 

finite leech bot with updated features 

like extract split and upload zip/unzip gdrive files using rclones
 
And yes Gautamajay repo is no more ,
or i was unable to find on github maybe banned or private

https://github.com/gautamajay52/TorrentLeech-Gdrive


we will be using this forked repo https://github.com/reaitten/tgtlg

to deploy it we need to fork it first

till then lets create a bot
then
if we want to use gdrive features then we need to add rclone.conf file as wel




wait for it to deploy but till then 
me was pausing video in between this tutorial because of some pvt chats in TG 

my bad was trying unzip instead of extract xD

Kindly if you have more requests for me 

send at @mikasa_xD

WE have now successfully deployed our bot TYSM for watching
